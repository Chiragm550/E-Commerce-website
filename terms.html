    <div class="width">
        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Redbubble website located at redbubble.com and the Redbubble mobile application or app comprise an online marketplace (the “Marketplace”) where independent artists (“Sellers”, “you” or “your”, as the context requires) upload their art, design products displaying their art, and offer those products for sale to their customers or their potential customers (“Customers”, “you” or “your”, as the context requires). This online community is about celebrating creativity, and we encourage all those visiting, browsing, using or otherwise accessing the Marketplace or using our Services, including Sellers and their Customers (collectively, “Users”, “you” or “your”, as the context requires), to be involved in every aspect of the community – by uploading and displaying art, designing products, offering them for sale to their Customers, browsing art, purchasing products, giving feedback and writing reviews, interacting with Customers, participating in forums, and teaming up with other members of the community to engage in meaningful discussions and to collaborate on projects.
<br><br>
            Most importantly, to ensure this online destination for creativity is available for all, it is essential that everyone respects the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademark rights and publicity rights. Sellers may only upload their original creations and only offer products for sale that display their original creations. If you are uploading or using something that you didn’t create yourself, then you must have permission from the applicable rights holder who owns that content. Respecting the intellectual property rights and other rights of everyone is an essential principle of the Marketplace.
<br><br>
            Also, displaying your art on the Marketplace puts it out there for the world to see. You need to be aware that publishing your Content in this way comes with important legal responsibilities. It is your responsibility to make sure you are not violating anyone’s rights or breaking any laws by using the Marketplace, including by publishing your Content, offering your Products for sale and otherwise using or accessing the services, including hosting and facilitation services, that Redbubble provides in connection with the Marketplace (“Services” or “Redbubble Services”).
            <br><br>
            If you are a Customer of a Seller, please be aware that Redbubble does not prescreen or review all the images and text that users upload or otherwise generate on the Marketplace (“User-generated Content”, ”UGC” or “Content”) or the Products offered for sale by Sellers. While Redbubble does not permit unlawful or unauthorized content on the Marketplace, Redbubble cannot guarantee that all of the Content or Products that Sellers may display or offer complies with this Agreement or the law. Sellers are responsible for their Content and for possessing the applicable rights to the Products they offer, and they are in the best position to respond to inquiries regarding their Content and their Products. Also, if you are just browsing others’ artwork and Product offerings, please respect the intellectual property rights of others and don’t steal their art or anyone else’s. All Users should respect each other and respect the art you find here, and if you do so, you will help make this community a creative, inspiring and enjoyable place.</p>
<br><br><br>
            <h3>LEGAL AGREEMENT</h3>
<br>
            <p>All Users are entering a binding legal agreement on the following terms (the “Agreement”). The Agreement is between the User and, as applicable, Redbubble Ltd (ABN 119 200 592), Redbubble Inc. and/or Redbubble Europe GmbH (“Redbubble”, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to either Redbubble Ltd, Redbubble Inc. or Redbubble Europe GmbH as the context requires) and your use of the Marketplace indicates your acceptance of this Agreement.</p>
<br><br><br>
            <h3>THE SERVICES</h3>
<br>
            <p>The Services, include, but are not limited to, providing a website and mobile app that facilitates Sellers’ upload and publication of their Content on the Marketplace and their design, sale, offer for sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and promotion of products that display their Content (“Products”) to their Customers and other Users; offering tools for Users’ discussions and interaction with other Users, including communications between Sellers and their Customers; Customers’ and potential Customers’ ability to view, browse, and purchase Products from Sellers; and enabling Users’ ability to receive the benefits of the Marketplace facilitation services, including the facilitation of the following: customer service interactions between Sellers and their Customers, payment processing by third parties, Sellers’ marketing and promotional activities on the Marketplace and offsite, and the distribution and manufacturing of Sellers’ Products by third parties. If a Customer decides to place an order for a Seller’s Product, then based on the Seller’s and Customer’s instructions, the Marketplace will forward the order information to independent third-party fulfillers (“Fulfillers”) who will manufacture and ship the Product in the form specified by Seller and their Customer.</p>
